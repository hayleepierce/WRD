Women sports are facing real problems Trans kids it The GOP obsession with trans people has led them and many others to ignore the real problems facing women in athletics Here are a few In their weird obsession with transgender people Republicans have honed in on a key line of attack ahead of this year midterm elections pushing to bar trans women from playing in women sports leagues From U S Senate candidate Herschel Walker of Georgia to Iowa Gov Kim Reynolds to Florida Sen Rick Scott who heads Senate Republicans campaign arm the GOP has been maniacally focused on keeping trans women from participating in women athletics And often framed this as though defending women sports from an assault Here the thing though Women sports are beset by all kinds of actual problems And trans people one of them But hold your breath waiting on Republicans to respond to any of the legitimate issues This past weekend I stumbled upon a panel discussion hosted by Harvard Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study earlier this summer on the passage of Title IX rules 50 years ago which prohibits discrimination from education related activities based on sex As the panelists made quite clear the discussion about how to truly improve and advocate for equality in women athletics since Title IX rules were codified as sophomoric as the conservative movement would have you believe It not trans kids destroying women sports it predictably misogynistic neglect And that weighs heavier on some women than others For example Bekah Salwasser the Boston Red Sox executive vice president of social impact noted that Title IX benefits including the expansion of women sports to high schools across the country have been concentrated among white women while frequently excluding Black and brown ones And journalist Shira Springer spoke to Traci Green who coaches women tennis at Harvard about the stubborn lack of women in coaching and athletic director positions at the college level Green noted that athletic directors have a powerful platform to advocate for neglected programs so having a woman in the role may help garner attention and support for often ignored women teams Harvard own Erin McDermott is one of the few women to hold that position at the college level One panelist writer and film director Melissa Johnson addressed right wing attacks on trans athletes head on Johnson a former basketball player called on people to reject a climate of panic and fear and scarcity about what a trans athlete is gonna mean for you None of these women who are steeped in knowledge about women sports cited trans kids as an existential threat Of course I trust these people far more than the conservative mostly men leading the charge against trans athletes Each of the panelists spoke to more pressing issues endangering women athletics patriarchal leadership structures denial of adequate equipment poor recruitment and media marginalization of women sports as a whole The Ignominious Timing of Trans Visibility Day State of the Union The government conveys the message it think about religious Christians at all Mary Harrington once wrote that America is a satanic theocracy Not in the literal sense of course but more in the literary sense of the word Perhaps Milton is to blame Harrington wrote Cromwell chief propagandist is famous for creating the most sympathetic Satan in literary history In Milton 1663 Biblical epic Paradise Lost Satan both longs for the Heaven he renounced but stubbornly refuses to be ruled declaring Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven To simplify the central thesis is that America is a society that is primed to ideologically worship radical self love to the point that it is a perpetual rebellion against any natural authority and hierarchy A plausible realist qualifier to that is that America is a revolutionary and ideologically Protestant society from its foundation that means unlike dispositionally satiated status quo powers it needs a sense of providential destiny and a sense of rebellion in relation to other powers and authorities That is perhaps all there is to it America stood against empires when imperialism was the global norm It then co opted proto imperialism to push back against other empires in its own hemisphere Imperial priorities dictated that America have an industrial base and expand from coast to coast Imperial priorities dictated a Teddy Rooseveltian educational system for a republican citizenry Imperial priorities decided asset prioritizations railways different English spellings and alliance with Britain pre world war The special relationship was purely imperial elite choice from both sides most Americans and Britons were ambivalent about it The Cold War was a conflict between ideological modernist cousins of liberalism and communism The secular liberals made peace with the religious fellow citizens to defeat the more fanatically secular and authoritarian fascism and communism Hollywood churned out pro faith and pro family propaganda until the alliance of convenience was over Today there is no competition to the elite liberals from the authoritarian left across the globe Naturally their Sauron like gaze is towards the faithful That why they see a Christian Russia to be far more a threat than the brutal authoritarian and secular China If tomorrow China truly threatens American power Hollywood will pivot towards worshiping faith flag and family again Unipolarity explains foreign and domestic policy Of course hierarchy is the natural state of affairs The argument that hierarchical disparity is not natural but material is the root justification for any totalitarianism To balance that the American liberal elite needs state power to actively discriminate or pressure one or other side By that logic you can justify unlimited external intervention and control to fix that always everywhere even things which are unfixable like culture in Afghanistan or educational and material disparity within our own country All that is to say that unlike the notion that America itself is a liberal satanic theocracy it is easier to see that America like the rest of the Anglosphere is under the thumb of a secular liberal priestly class A farmer in Idaho or a small businessman in Ohio has more in common with one in Mansfield UK or on the shores of the Volga than the sociology department at Yale or the gender studies faculty at Rutgers And that explains more than anything why the liberal priest class celebrates Easter as the new Transgender Day of Visibility The presidential day of visibility edict a random event It was a deliberate targeted powerplay by those who know their core support group across the country and the globe Presidential edicts are always like royal charters every single word thought out and planned If you get that you get politics The question here therefore about state neutrality The American state has never been neutral or even aspired to be neutral That is a myth The current elite and the state is actively undermining one side and promoting the other The idea that elegiacs to neutrality can and will defend against this elite ideology is a ludicrous concept It is at the end of the day like all conflicts hot or cold a theological war Of course one can refuse to have a theocracy and that fine The chances of having a Protestant Franco are near zero But the Dawkinsian idea that the American state can be truly secular without a worldview dictated by a specific religion is also absurd and ahistorical There will always be a faith some sort of a faith Even the Jacobins a movement qualitatively similar to modern American liberal internationalists worshipped reason in a temple It is pretty much that To change that change the ruling class and install a counter elite Restructuring the modes of propaganda reforming the universities the bureaucracy and state theology is the way to change the country It happen in one day and neutrality win a theological conflict In Edward Watts fascinating book The Final Pagan Generation the cultural shift that engulfed Europe took over a period of four hundred years Romans who were used to old gods and older ways continued with their traditions but that got mixed with new symbols People were buried with both wooden gods and crucifixes as a new faith slowly engulfed the old But the two most important factors were state powers and time of change Romans only changed when the state symbolism changed the revolution was top down and one set of elites replaced the other set It took centuries to transform society There is a tendency among the commentariat to cherry pick holy books and scriptures that justify one ideology the liberals focusing on eliminating poverty and the conservatives focusing more on virtue and sexuality But as a military historian the most important lesson one can draw about implementing political power from the rise and establishment of Christianity is the necessity of steady martial resolve The changes will be elite driven and come from the top It will be stable subtle and resolute without verging on fanatical idiotic and overtly preachy And it will take time Why Spain is trusting trans teens on their gender rather than restricting them Dictator Gen Francisco Franco rule was a grim era for Spain transgender community At the time a trans person could be taken from the streets to prison without any chance to consult a lawyer and be kept there for as long as a judge saw fit recalls Mar Cambrollé who has been fighting for trans rights since General Franco died in 1975 and now is president of the transgender rights association Federación Plataforma Trans A Franco mindset no longer shapes Spain view of gender identity Just in the last 20 years the country has undergone a radical shift in how it perceives its transgender community particularly trans youth Last year the country adopted legislation allowing anyone age 12 or over to change their legal status to match their gender identity though those under 17 would need judicial or parental consent depending on their age Why We Wrote This A story focused on Compassion In some U S states changing one gender identity is seen as too weighty a decision for those under the age of 18 But Spain has taken a different approach based on trusting transgender teens choices Tragedies like the recent death of high schooler Nex Benedict in Oklahoma have drawn fresh attention to the rights and experiences of trans teens Some jurisdictions including a number of U S states are tightening laws against changing gender identity But in Spain the desire to protect youth has produced the opposite response Ten years ago trans people were seen as sick people in Spain says Aingeru Mayor author of the book Transitos which draws on the testimonies of parents with trans children But children do not generate the same rejection that adult trans people generated They appeal to society instinct to care for its cubs And now across Europe there is broad acceptance of trans people in society including allowing them to change their legal status to match their gender identity which 62% of Europeans support according to Eurobarometer data published in December Some European countries which have been historic leaders on LGBT rights like same sex marriage are recognizing that trans people have been excluded from some of the advances that have occurred in the last two decades says Cristian González Cabrera a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch These populations have unique needs and there is a shift to be increasingly inclusive and intersectional and finally address the historical debt that many countries have to this historically marginalized group The law was a miracle Ivan who was assigned female at birth resented wearing pretty dresses to weddings as a child As a teen he wore makeup and feminine attire but felt like he was role playing He cringed when called by his birth name But by chance in 2020 while getting a COVID 19 vaccine someone referred to him using a masculine pronoun That moment felt fantastic I liked it so much I had to ask myself why he says So when Spain new law on gender self identification came into effect Ivan then 16 years old wasted no time setting up an appointment to change his information in the Spanish civil registry Ivan whose last name is being withheld valued being able to start the process discreetly without looping in his parents although in the end his mother accompanied him to formally present the request The law was a miracle to be honest says Ivan It struck me as positive that young people who are not emancipated can start the process on the own There are cases of parents kicking out their children because they are trans Making the change at 16 rather than 18 meant the opportunity to earn a high school diploma that aligned with his sense of self Once I came out I had no more doubts he shares on a WhatsApp call taken during a break from studying chemistry in the region of Galicia Just a month after the law went into effect Ivan had shared his identity at home and at school It went smoothly Only one of his brothers struggled initially with Ivan identity and new name thinking the change may have been a passing phase inspired by TikTok Going to an association to support the families of trans youth helped allay his parents nerves around the health consequences of hormonal treatment It seems to be a recent thing that people can talk about it he says Before maybe you got killed or a beating Now there is more protection or support so more people dare to come out Carla Antonelli the first openly transgender person to serve in a Spanish regional parliament raises her gloved hands representing hands stained with blood as she and others vote against a proposal to strip protections for trans people at Madrid regional parliament Dec 22 2023 A reality that you could even imagine An outcome like Ivan would have been inconceivable even a decade ago Until 2013 the concept of a trans child was virtually unheard of in Spain That changed in large part because the work of the country first association for families with trans children and adolescents Chrysallis The organization provided vital support to trans youth at a time when the knowledge of psychologists psychiatrists and social workers on trans identities was still anchored on the concept of it being a pathology It was a reality that you could even imagine until then it seemed like trans people have a childhood that they just came out in adulthood says Bea Sever president of Naizen the Basque and Navarre Association of Families with Trans Minors However if you listen to their story realize that they all tell you I knew it since I was a little even though I know how to put words to it Some of these families shared their stories with the public helping others to come to terms with the reality they were facing In Spain there are more and more families that can accompany their sons their daughters because they know that what their sons and daughters are expressing is possible says Mr Mayor the author Experts say that such activism was crucial for paving the way to Spain gender self identification law They also point to the prominence in recent years of various trans personalities in music film and television for helping familiarize society with their struggles A different outcome In the end the self identification law passed with a firm majority Though there was acrimonious debate over the law it played between the left wing parties says Javier Corral Diaz a journalist who wrote his thesis about its reverberations on social media Anti trans feminists raised concerns that trans rights gains could come at the expense of women The core of the debate revolved around whether sex is a cultural construct or something truly natural he says But the right and far right parties kept relatively quiet Mr Corral suggests that may be a sign of progress in a country where social mores were once shaped primarily by the Catholic Church That not to say there been pushback While the national government and many regional governments may enable young trans people to legally express their identities a few regions do not have laws recognizing such trans rights These regions still do have to recognize the genders recorded in the national registry But their lack of such legislation or in the case of Madrid regional government their repeal of trans rights laws in December indicates there is still a conservative backlash against gender identity laws Still the rise of associations helping families of trans children has helped society to see trans people in a kinder light It is never the parents who want their children to be the sex they appear to be or another sex says Jokin Zurutuza the father of a 13 year old girl She was assigned male at birth but socially transitioned at age 9 with the support of her parents and school It not that we parents are extra progressive parents who like these things he adds No we are normal moms and dads and we want our son to be a son and our daughter to be a daughter But more than that we have to be loving people to our children and love has to be above all else California became the first state to bar school districts from requiring staff to notify parents of their child gender identification change under a law signed Monday by Gov Gavin Newsom The law bans school rules requiring teachers and other staff to disclose a student gender identity or sexual orientation to any other person without the child permission Proponents of the legislation say it will help protect LGBTQ students who live in unwelcoming households But opponents say it will hinder schools ability to be more transparent with parents The legislation comes amid a nationwide debate over local school districts and the rights of parents and LGBTQ students This law helps keep children safe while protecting the critical role of parents Brandon Richards a spokesperson for Newsom said in a statement It protects the child parent relationship by preventing politicians and school staff from inappropriately intervening in family matters and attempting to control if when and how families have deeply personal conversations The new law comes after several school districts in California passed policies requiring that parents be notified if a child requests to change their gender identification That led to pushback by Democratic state officials who say students have a right to privacy But Jonathan Zachreson an advocate in California who supports the parental notification policies opposes the law and said telling parents about a student request to change their gender identification is critical to the well being of children and for maintaining that trust between schools and parents States across the country have sought to impose bans on gender affirming care bar transgender athletes from girls and women sports and require schools to out trans and nonbinary students to their parents Some lawmakers in other states have introduced bills with broad language requiring that parents are told of any changes to their child emotional health or well The California law led to heated debate in the state Legislature LGBTQ lawmakers have shared stories about how it was difficult for them to decide when to come out to their families arguing that transgender students should be able to share that part of their identity on their own terms State Assemblymember Bill Essayli a Republican representing part of Riverside County is an outspoken opponent of the law He has criticized Democratic leaders for preventing a bill he introduced last year that would have required parents to be told of their childs gender identification change from receiving a hearing In Northern California the Anderson Union High School District board approved a parental notification policy last year But the teachers union recommended that teachers not enforce the rule while the union is involved in a labor dispute with the district over the policy said Shaye Stephens an English teacher and president of the teachers association at the district The notification policies put teachers in an unfair position Stephens said kind of a lose lose situation for teachers and administrators or anybody being asked to do this I think safe for students she said I do not think that we are the right people to be having those conversations with a parent or a guardian parents students and staff members in the Chino Valley Unified School District hold up signs in favor of protecting LGBTQ policies went after trans Paralympian sprinter Valentina Petrillo and failed The once beloved children author was back at it this week going on at length about a Italian Paralympic sprinter who happens to be transgender If you thought JK Rowling was done ranting about transgender athletes now that the Paris Olympic Games have long been over you d be wrong After taking about two weeks off from social media the once beloved children author was back at it this week going on at length about 51 year old Valentina Petrillo an Italian Paralympic sprinter who happens to be transgenderRowling gender critical allies also decried Petrillo participation in the Games as unfair and called on Paralympic officials to ban trans women from the Games Rowling posted a grainy photo of Petrillo on X and wrote Why all the anger about the inspirational Petrillo The cheat community has never had this kind of visibility Out and proud cheats like Petrillo prove the era of cheat shaming is over What a role model I say we give Lance Armstrong his medals back and move on Elsewhere several of Rowling gender critical allies also decried Petrillo participation in the Games as unfair and called on Paralympic officials to ban trans women from the Games This inclusive policy in the name of being progressive is actually regressive as the policy excludes women because tennis legend Martina Navratilova wrote on Navratilova who has long been vocal about her preference for excluding trans women from womanhood in general continued You find women who identify as men taking places of Males because BIOLOGY Males and females are different Period Sharron Davies a former Olympic swimmer turned anti trans media darling called on sport authorities to do what everyone can see is right rather than what easy and ban trans athletes But here the thing Petrillo failed to qualify for the T12 400 meter final after she finished third in her semifinal heat In that race the trans runner recorded a personal best time of 5758 seconds finishing behind Iran Hajar Safarzadeh Ghahderijani by a full second and a half In sprint events that a lifetime Petrillo began her medical transition in 2019 after a long career winning Para athletic national titles as a male athlete Her times now are significantly slower than they were before which suggests that the hormone change had a real impact on her athletic ability As the Games began Ukrainian runner Oksana Boturchuk was one of several of Petrillo cisgender female competitors critical of Petrillo participation I find this not fair in my opinion Boturchuk told BBC Sport Boturchuk said she is not against transgender people in general but in this situation I do not understand and support it Unlike Petrillo Boturchuk made the final finishing well ahead of the trans runner she implied had an unfair advantage Opening ceremony for Paralympic Games in Paris Petrillo failure to dominate she came short of making the final race in the T12 200 meter dash Friday is yet another example of a trans athlete miraculously not winning an elite sporting competition that people such as Rowling and Navratilova claimed would be unfair In 2016 trans discus thrower Ingrid van Kranen finished ninth at the Paralympics and no one even noticed her participation because conservatives here and abroad yet chosen trans athletes as a political target Without the political fervor stoked by conservatives and the likes of Rowling Petrillo participation would probably have gone unnoticed as well So would have 2021 Olympic weightlifter Laurel Hubbard who failed to record a single lift and finished last in her division at the Tokyo Games We keep hearing about how trans athletes have a natural advantage in sports and yet weve yet to see a trans athlete win an elite international title in any sport   no Lia Thomas does not count for this While Thomas did win an NCAA title it was at the amateur collegiate not elite level and her times were not necessarily comparable with the best swimmers in the world

Petrillos failure to dominate is yet another example of a trans athlete miraculously not winning an elite sporting competition that people such as Rowling and Navratilova claimed would be unfair

It seems as if gender critical activists have noticed that trans athletes losing big competitions contradicts their argument that they have an unfair advantage So those activists have recently shifted away from claiming that trans women would dominate all sports and instead accused trans women of taking away a spot from a more deserving cis woman

Im a little more sympathetic to this argument and its a clever play on emotions especially for parents who may be hoping their daughters can one day get an athletic scholarship and avoid crippling educational debt But this line of thinking also results in the total exclusion of trans women athletes from all sports


Part 2 A special panel discussion on transgender youth in athletics
0728
There hasnt been a trans athlete yet whose performance improved or even remained the same after starting estrogen Those performances typically get worse consistent with the general difference between cis mens and cis womens performances in many athletic measurements There is no way to get fairness for trans athletes by forcing them to compete against cis men Biology or not that type of exclusionary policy would be a de facto ban on trans women athletes completely

As we wrestle with these new ideas of sex and fairness we must value trans humanity equally with cis people The proof is in the pudding Trans women are not dominating womens sports and never will Petrillos relatively poor performance on the track should put an end to Rowlings rage but of course Rowling is past the point of no return She will seethe and rage about trans people for the rest of her life because she is a bigot Does Science Have a Place in Solving Transgenderism
A review of Lost in Transnation recognizes that transgender ideology can not be solved by science alone Puberty blockers vaginoplasty phalloplasty and gender affirming care none of these terms were mainstream five years ago Today as article after article and book after book demonstrate these terms describe the harm done to thousands of children The progressive states of Europe have begun rolling back their government endorsed support of transgender ideology and surgery while both the United States and Canada have federal administrations pushing for increases in such care at taxpayer expense

The problem is real The question is what can we do about it Miriam Grossmans new book Lost in Transnation A Child Psychiatrist  Guide Out of the Madness promises in both title and text to give parents solutions to the transgender craze Unfortunately Lost in Transnation fails to understand the nature of the enemy and the necessary response

Transgender ideology is an iteration of the myth of modernism You are a spiritual substance contained within your body and through surgical changes you can make your body align with your inner self This is not a scientific problem where people make wrong choices because they lack data Grossman limits her conclusions to what she can support by scientific studies and fails to engage with the transgender narrative on the level of truth

In a discussion of the American Academy of Pediatrics Grossman notes that While these issues may warrant attention so does the permanent disfigurement and sterilization of kids without strong evidence of lasting benefit It is logically impossible for strong evidence of lasting benefit to come from permanent disfigurement and sterilization of kids but Grossman does not conclude that the AAPs standards are wrong Instead she implies that further study is warranted before such a conclusion can be drawn Her reliance on scientific study fails to recognize that transgender ideology is a myth The answer to a false myth is not scientific studies but a more true explanation of reality

For the imaginary parent searching for all existing studies of transgender questions Grossman summarizes those clearly She offers parents scripts modeling hard conversations with children who request opposite gender names and pronouns She describes children who have gone through therapy and found healing from their disorders through therapeutic conversations She illustrates the healthy therapeutic approach in contrast to gender affirming care A therapist should seek to peel back the layers of causality and thought to determine why a boy or girl seeks an alternate identity rather than affirming that desire and using licensure to facilitate access to puberty blockers and surgery The stories she tells are Grossmans most effective sections She brings the readers into her mindset and shows her concern for children who pursue self harm

Her overall argument however suffers from several significant flaws Grossman critiques the cult of the expert that sweeps children into the gender affirmation pipeline social hormonal and surgical transition She depicts parents who go along with therapists doctors and WPATH guidelines because thats what the experts say But she does this after having established her own credentials as an expert and refuses to say that the people she condemns are wrong Instead she shows that they lack scientific evidence and consensus for their decisions advice and actions

If scientific evidence supporting immediate transition could be produced Grossman leaves open the possibility that she would support the decisions made by medical professionals To this day mental health professionals are at one anothers throats over the proper approach to patients with gender dysphoria There is no consensus Even if consensus existed gender affirming care would still be a wrong application of therapy Grossmans analysis does not specifically condemn gender affirming care but suggests that without consensus parents should not permit it

Grossman offers direct advice to parents Her advice rejects the transgender narrative but fails to offer a positive vision of the human person in its place Her analysis recalls Jesus words about the man whose demon was cast out without replacing the demon with right worship the demon returned to the mans soul with seven other spirits and the last state of that person is worse than the first Matthew 1245

A wrong idea must be replaced with a right idea but Grossman does not offer specific right ideas to replace transgender ideology Below is a representative quote where Grossman writes directly to parents

To all that I would add your child is a sponge ready to absorb whatever comes his way He is a work in progress and you are his scaffolding providing support and structure If you dont provide a belief system a compass or some meaningful foundation from which to understand the world identify truth and lies and know right from wrong trust me others are waiting eagerly to do just that Before you know it your child is a pawn a foot soldier in a foreign crusade of dark and dangerous ideas and youre the toxic parent with a home thats unsafe

Without grounding the moral compass she recommends Grossman leaves parents without specific help to combat transgenderism on an imaginative level 

People do not join or leave cults because they read studies showing the benefits or harms of cultlife Instead they are motivated by charisma and the story told by the cult If Matt Walsh is right to call transgenderism a cult then a scientific analysis is insufficient It is self evident that halting puberty is harmful removing either the penis or vagina is a violation of human health We dont need scientists to study this question and write up the conclusions

Instead we need to live a different story Rather than embracing a neo gnostic vision of the self as encased within the body the healthy imagination perceives reality as a gift The task of education is to prepare the person body mind and soul to receive that gift and live within it The task does not require further use of children as scientific guinea pigs Our need instead is to re enchant the mind to perceive the wonder of reality and to live in alignment with the real

Transgender ideology is not a failure of science Science cannot declare the objects it studies right or wrong that is a moral philosophical and ultimately theological question Transgender ideology is a theological myth that posits the self as creator of reality with the body as its primary act of creation The myth is self evidently false No human has the power to alter the body at will which is where hormones and surgery comes in

Transgenderism promises happiness it cannot deliver Happiness is located within the creational order and the transgender myth demands rejecting the very grounds of happiness Grossman appeals to scientific studies to help parents respond to children who hear the siren call of transgenderism but in doing so she brings the wrong weapons to the fight This fight is not won with scientific evidence but rather through learning the right story about ourselves Humans are not gods We do not make reality Instead we are contingent beings in a complex world who find happiness in learning to receive reality and live within the gift California Wants to Take Trans Children From Their Parents
State of the Union A new bill would make a parent  refusal to affirm a child  gender identity grounds for losing custody To see the America the Democratic Party wants look to CaliforniaAssembly Bill 927 introduced by Assemblyman Lori Wilson would amend the state  family code to make parents  affirmation of their children  gender identity a criterion in custody disputes Judges would be able to grant or deny parents custody of their children at least in part on the basis of whether they affirm their children false beliefs about their sex beliefs that in many cases will change over time

Non affirming parents are considered especially grave sinners in the progressive moral universe because they commit what progressives consider the worst sin of all: denying another person  autonomy even when that person is a child your child and even when that person is manifestly delusional

Earlier this year Washington State passed a bill allowing youth services providers to decline to inform the parents of runaways that their children received gender affirming care while on the lam The Biden CDC set up a chat room targeted at transgender identifying children particularly LGBTQ youth in the South who may have been confined non affirming home environments These are whispers of what California Democrats are now saying out loud: Toe the line or we will take your child from you
