# 🤔 What is WRD?

[WRD](https://wrd.chompe.rs/) stands for **W**ord **R**ating **D**atabase. It is a website that allows users to give words a sentiment rating on a scale of 1 to 5. The users' ratings impact the words' overall scores, which are stored in a database containing over 1,000 words. WRD was created as a quick, easy, and accessible way to curate a labeled dataset.

# 🔍 How does the search feature work?

There are *two* ways that you can search using WRD:

1. Search for a specific word by entering the word into the search bar. If the word is in the database, it will appear in the search result. You can then clink on the word to rate it.

2. Search for all words under a tag by typing `tag:` followed by the tag you wish to search for. All words using the tag will appear in the search results. You can click on any of the resulting word to rate them.

# 🔒 How do I access the database?

The database can be accessed as a JSON or a CSV file. You can download the entire database in either format by using the links on the home page. You can also download the resulting database entries of a search in either format by using the links on the search results page.
